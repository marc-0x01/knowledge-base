# Welcome to my Knowledge base!

This is essentially a place, where I keep track of information. I mostly use it as support to my learning process... It's like my own tech Digital Garden, full of references about the *platforms*, *stacks*, *tools* and *practices* I am using or interested in. 

It allows me to search in and find easily ideas, references, links, personals notes and all kind of stuff I can and want to keep a trace of.

> From me to you : I create this project mostly for myself! So if the notes seems messy or telegraphic,  it is most probably that **it fits my mental model and not necessary yours**. 

## Kind of notes
Notes can be quick grabs but I usually try to keep things tidy by using the following categories / templates for my notes: 

| File                                    | Description               | Modified                   |
| --------------------------------------- | ------------------------- | -------------------------- |
| [Stack](./Stack.md)           | Template for a Stack      | 3:58 PM - January 24, 2024 |
| [Platform](./Platform.md)     | Template for a Platform   | 4:01 PM - January 24, 2024 |
| [Service](./Service.md)       | Template for a Service    | 4:01 PM - January 24, 2024 |
| [Tool](./Tool.md)             | Template for a Tool       | 4:01 PM - January 24, 2024 |
| [Cheatsheet](./Cheatsheet.md) | Template for a Cheatsheet | 1:39 PM - January 24, 2024 |
| [Practice](./Practice.md)     | Template for a Practice   | 4:01 PM - January 24, 2024 |


## Radar
Whenever make sense, I assign *radar* properties to notes specifying a quadrant and ring. This is a highly personal view materialising my position on the technology and my degree of fluency in it.

The *quadrant* regroups broad categories of the tech space. Allocation of note is based on the kind property.
1. **Stacks** -  The languages and related frameworks/libraries that make their ecosystem
2. **Platforms and Services** - Capabilities consolidated into platforms and individual services. Mostly on the deployment and operation side of things
3. **Tools** - Tooling used as part of tech processes or supporting tech processes
4. **Practices** - The tech/business techniques or overarching concepts/methodologies driving our daily practice as a tech professional

The *ring* represent my personal and opinionated recommendation about the technology. 
1. **Adopt** - Technology adopted and fit for a generalised used
2. **Trial** - Technology still have prove its value, but we can give it a try for a specific use case
3. **Assess** - Technology is promising and should be assessed  through a proof-of-concept or spikes to demonstrate early value
5. **Hold** - Technology lacks some important characteristics, has been superseded, and we should -for the moment- refrain from using it

The *stage* represent my personnel fluency and degree of expertise into the technology.
1. **Awareness** - Basic understanding of the technology, it's purpose, main characteristics, best usage and pros/cons.
2. **Practitioner** - Good understanding of the technology, with real world experience and regular use of it.
3. **Expert** - Advance and deep level of understanding of the technology, its "internals" with the ability to guide other in its application in a wide range of use cases.
4. **Guru** - Leading the field and deeply involved in the community or company driving the technology.
