## About

A repository of tech notes extracted from my [obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) tech vault. 

### Why ?

* 🔮 The biggest beneficiary of you trying to help past you is future you!
* 💡 This is my effort to [learning in public](https://www.swyx.io/learn-in-public) and produce *Learning Exhaust* as a byproduct of educating myself.
* 🦮 As an architect: be a guide, not a guru! 

## Features

- 📓 Just markdown files
- 🧱 Organised around the following typology: _Stacks_, _Platforms_, _Practices_, _Services_, _Tools_ and _Cheatsheets_
- 🧑‍🏫 Open to everyone!
